## Style Tiles 

Style Tiles are design deliverables for web design that help establish a common visual language between designers and stakeholders. They serve as a bridge between moodboards and literal mockups, presenting interface choices without investing in multiple full mockups. By listening to the client's needs, asking relevant questions, and interpreting feedback, designers can define a visual language and create Style Tiles that match client preferences. These iterative tiles allow for faster revisions and facilitate discussions over the visual language, making them an effective tool in the web design process, especially for clients with established brands transitioning to the web. Additionally, Style Tiles are compatible with responsive design, complementing static comps and reinforcing visual themes for different devices and platforms.

## Brand Fonts 

Picking the perfect brand fonts involves understanding your brand personality and aligning it with suitable font categories. Serif fonts evoke a classic, traditional, and trustworthy feel, while sans-serif fonts offer a modern and clean appearance. Slab serif fonts are bold and quirky, script fonts exude elegance, handwritten fonts are informal and artistic, and decorative fonts are stylized and distinctive. Consider your budget and licensing requirements before choosing free or paid fonts. To create a cohesive brand identity, pair fonts that complement your brand personality, and ensure the selected fonts are unique, legible, and flexible for various platforms and applications.

## Color Theory, Practive, and Inspiration 

Creating a website color scheme is a crucial aspect of web design, as it influences branding and user communication. Before selecting colors, understand your brand and target audience. For established brands, consider the recognized color scheme and explore opportunities for change. New brands require defining a color scheme that aligns with their values. Color theory is essential in making informed choices, and color psychology can evoke specific emotions in users. Start with the primary brand color and select two or three secondary colors that harmonize well. Test the color scheme for contrast and accessibility, and apply colors strategically to highlight important elements and create a seamless user experience. Finally, seek inspiration from websites with effective color schemes. Through careful planning and testing, you can create a website color scheme that enhances your brand's identity and resonates with your audience.

## Types of Textures 

Using background textures in web design can enhance the overall visual appeal and depth of a website. Here are seven tips to use background textures effectively:

1. **Go Simple and Understated**: Use subtle and small repeating patterns that don't distract from the main content but add visual interest.

2. **Go Big and Bold**: Opt for large and bold background textures that make a statement and complement text-heavy designs.

3. **Incorporate a Trend**: Use modern design trends, such as geometric shapes or layered textures, to create a fresh and contemporary look.

4. **Use an Image**: Instead of traditional repeating patterns, use images related to the brand or messaging to add a unique touch to the background.

5. **Use Color Variations**: Mix and match tints and tones from the same color palette to create a vibrant and textured background.

6. **Grab a Gradient**: Utilize trendy gradients to add depth and visual engagement to the background, either alone or layered with other elements.

7. **Animate It**: Consider using subtle animations or video backgrounds to add dynamic elements to the website.

## Why Wireframe

Wireframes are a crucial part of website design, serving as the foundation for building a website. They are simple black and white layouts that outline page elements, features, and navigation. Wireframes help visualize site architecture, prioritize usability, and address scalability and ease-of-update. They also facilitate an iterative design process, save time on the entire project, and have proven to be essential for creating high-converting websites.

Some suggest skipping wireframes to speed up the process or due to clients' lack of understanding. However, this approach can lead to costly consequences and missing key components. At Orbit, layouts are used instead of traditional wireframes, going beyond the wireframe by including draft copy and container structure. This ensures better integration of UX and conversion-focused copywriting and helps guide clients effectively through the website design process, resulting in a more compelling and functional website.
